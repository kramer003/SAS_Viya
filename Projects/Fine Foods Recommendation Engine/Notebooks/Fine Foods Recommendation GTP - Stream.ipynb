    "Factorization Machine (FM) is one of the newest algorithms in the Machine Learning space, and has been developed in SAS. FM is a general prediction algorithm, similar to Support Vector Machines, that can model very sparce data, an area where traditional Machine Learning techniques fail. \n",

    "Since FM is a general prediction algorithm, it can accept any sized real vector as inputs. Because of this, we will use SAS Viya text analytics capabilities to represent text as numeric vectors, that we can use as inputs to our FM model.\n",
